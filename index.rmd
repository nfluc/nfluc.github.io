## Bio

I'm a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University in the lab of Dr. Anirban Sen Gupta. My research focuses on designing various nanoparticles and biomaterials that mimic platelets for hemostasis and wound healing. At the moment, I'm open to a career in academia, industry, or possibly science policy. In my spare time, I like to cook, bake, explore, and take photos, some of which I've featured here. I also play chess, poker, Pokemon Go, and ultimate Frisbee, and I love keeping up to date on sports, news, and politics.
